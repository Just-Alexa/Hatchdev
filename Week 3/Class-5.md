# Class 5

Object orientation says treat everything as an object

COMPOSITION & AGGREGATION
Composition is basically a class having other classes as a state. States are properties of a class. In composition we are creating an "as-a" relationship.

Parser is the rules of concord in english language. Basically give me an input string i will pass it to the defined rules to check if it's valid.

In typescript by convention a class is in pascal case and the rest is in camel case.
